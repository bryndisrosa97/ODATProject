### Overview

In today's fast-paced world, where time seems to slip away, and various tasks and responsibilities accumulate for young individuals, there has never been a greater need for tools that help users plan their lives simply and maintain an overview of their main goals and events. Most people have probably wished for more hours in a day at some point.

While it's neither feasible nor realistic to plan every single detail of life, the goal of our project, "One Day at a Time," is to enable users to keep track of most aspects of their lives in one convenient place, reducing the need for multiple specialized applications.

In this implementation, which will be in the form of a mobile app, we will focus on creating a user-friendly interface with clear instructions. Our aim is to develop an application that can be used by the majority of people without requiring significant time to learn its specifics.

## What this project tought me 

The project, which was defined and designed in the Software Project 1 course, is refined, implemented, tested, deployed, and delivered. This includes implementation in stages, adherence to programming standards, documentation, software traceability and verification, error-free programming, evaluating the scope of software systems, testing methodologies, conducting evaluations and quality assessments on software projects, scrutinizing design and implementation, system deployment and reception, software system lifecycle, measurements in software creation, and international standards for software development.

Learning outcomes:
Upon completion of the course, students can:

Define, classify, and apply quality models for software in system development projects
Maintain and develop software
Identify and review products from software development projects
Review the process for software development and make suggestions for improvements to it.
